Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! 🚀
This repository is the personal gym for many problems presented on LeetCode. I do it for two main reasons: 
1) Hobby. Yes, it's a hobby. If I ask myself: How did you start programming? I started because I liked to solve problems and puzzles.
2) Brain health. I want to take my programming skills well-oiled through the years. As a software developer, I wear many hats. From architectures to raw coding, from testing to query optimization, from bug fixing to devOps problems. But I cannot accept the idea of losing all the happYness, security and self-confidence when solving tricky programming problems. Stay young!
3) Coding interview. A serious position in software development cannot skip some questions about the basics of coding. Maybe not full or complex algorithms, IMO, verifying the mindset to solve a problem could be an indicator of how a developer approaches or investigates it.

But as someone said: "Be careful, programming is usually more than just algorithms. For real-life projects the architecture of the program, the structure of the project, tests are very important. And the way you'll do it is very specific for each language. Pure programming problems from the sites from above don't give you an overview of these aspects"
